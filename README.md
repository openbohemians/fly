FUNCTIONS LOVE YAML
===================

Fly is **reactive** **functional** programming language.

You can think of it bit like a spreadsheet, but orgnaized as a tree instead of a table.

The current prototype is a Ruby program with a Forth-like scripting language. It also supports Ruby scripting. The underlying scripting language is still an open question. It may be possible to support any programming language and use YAML (or more likely JSYNC) for message passing between them. In that can FLY becomes something of a *meta-language*. Obvisouly that won't win points for being particularlly fast, but it sure would be damn flexible.

FLY is a *ractive* language. Like a spreadsheet, when any cell changes all other dependent cells are immediately updated. Cell can be linked to external sources, such as webpage fields. This create a very dynamic GUI system with very little overhead.
